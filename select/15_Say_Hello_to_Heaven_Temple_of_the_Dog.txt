Please mother mercy
Take me from this place
And the long-winded kisses
I hear in my head
Words never listen
And teachers, oh, they never learn
Warm from the candle
Though i feel too cold to burn
He came from an island
And he died from the street
And he hurt so bad like a soul breaking
But he never said nothing to me

Heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven
Heaven, heaven
New like a baby
And lost like a prayer
The sky was your playground
But the cold ground was your bed
Oh, i said, poor star-gazer
She's got no tears in her eyes
But smooth like a whisper
She knows that love heals all wounds with time
Now it seems like too much love is never enough
Yeah, you better seek out another road 'cause
This one's ended abrupt
I, i never wanted
To write these words down for you
With the pages
Of (?) all the things we never do
Hey, so i blow out, out the candle
And i put you to bed
Since you can't say to me now
