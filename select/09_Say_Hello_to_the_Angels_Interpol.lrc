[00:40.39] I want your silent parts, the parts the birds love
[00:43.90] I know there's such a place
[00:49.03] I had my back turned, you didn't realize
[00:53.03] I'm lonely
[00:58.78] You lack the things to which I relate
[01:02.65] But I see no harm
[01:07.85] Come wait, come wait, come wait
[01:11.30] It's over
[01:14.80] Yeah, one, two, three, do me
[01:28.80] 
[01:22.12] When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
[01:24.29] I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
[01:26.56] My airspace
[01:28.42] Move into my airspace
[01:31.22] And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
[01:33.63] I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into
[01:35.80] My airspace
[01:37.77] Move into my airspace
[01:48.27] 
[01:40.25] But each night, I bury my love around you
[01:48.94] Oh, each night, I bury my love around you
[01:56.61] You're linked to my innocence
[02:11.11] 
[01:58.86] This is a concept, this is a bracelet
[02:03.60] This isn't no intervention
[02:08.58] This is a concept, this is a bracelet
[02:13.47] This isn't no intervention
[02:26.47] 
[02:16.89] This isn't you yet
[02:21.45] What you thought was such a conquest
[02:26.68] Your hair is so pretty and red
[02:31.23] Baby, baby, you're really the best
[02:48.23] 
[02:47.05] Can I get there this way? Yeah, I think so
[02:49.27] Can I get there this way? I think so
[02:51.52] Can I get there this way? Can I get there this way?
[02:53.95] Can I get there this way? Can I get there this way?
[03:19.45] 
[02:56.15] We should take a trip now to see new places
[02:58.53] I'm sick of this town, I see my face has changed
[03:05.38] We should take a trip now to see new places
[03:07.74] I'm sick of this town, I see my face has changed
[03:31.74] 
[03:50.50] Say hello, say hello, to the angels
[03:59.92] Say hello, say hello
[04:09.45] To the angels
